  - I'm finally launching an official website with some real content. The website in its current form, is a work in progress, and is more functional than cosmetic at the moment, but at least there is a real site now.
    It currently looks very much like a website from the 90s or early 00s, but I thought it better to have something that doesn't look great, than to wait and wait until it's perfect, which might be weeks or even months.
    <br/><br/>
    The reason for me getting the site out now is that I want to start writing a weekly 'dev' blog to give insight on the work I've completed each week towards whatever project is ongoing.
    At the moment, that is a new game that is super early on in the works. I can probably talk about it, but I haven't actually confirmed that yet, so best to hold off on naming what game it is.
    <br/><br/>
    The fact that a big part of this site will be run as a blog is the reason I have chosen to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> which has been recommended to me by various people, as it is a quick and easy way to generate a static site with blog posts,
    as opposed to having to maintain a CMS or something like that. Each blog post can be written in very basic plain text, and sections of the post will then be dropped into a template page that has all the HTML and CSS in it, so once that template is made once, it can be reused over and over.
  - In the left picture is the text for this blog post, and in the right image is the template file used.
