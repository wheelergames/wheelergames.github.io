<p>
  Wheeler Games is a solo dev bringing adaptations of board games to the digital world, via mobile apps and in the future PC and console versions too.

<p>
  Starting out in 2017, I have so far bought two games to market on Android and iOS, with a third game currently underway, which will hopefully also come to PC and possibly even Nintendo Switch as well.
